## Summary

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience with an emphasis on backend systems and JVM languages.

In my professional journey I have learned that abstract thinking, isolating responsibilities along with proper risk management and prioritisation are
essential engineering skills to design and implement software that is maintainable and scales.

I might not be the smartest guy of the class, but my motivation, dedication, perseverance and passion for crafting software has allowed me to overcome every
challenge I have come accross :)

These are some relevant soft & technical skills that I have:

- Highly empathetic, open minded and easy going individual

- Experience mentoring and guiding peers
- Pragmatic and simple approach to solve problems
- Eager to learn new stuff and fast learner
- Proficient on various programming languages (Java, JavaScript/Node.js, Groovy)
- Broad experience in business domain modeling and software design
- Test-driven approach to software development
- Experience in thread safe & concurrent software
- Practical knowledge of functional and reactive programming
- REST & SOAP API design
- Experience in building scalable and observable distributed/micro-services architectures

## Professional experience

### Senior Software Engineer at Marfeel | Barcelona, Spain | Jun 2020 - Present (~1y)

At Marfeel I'm part of one of the core platform teams where I'm shipping performant, reliable and maintainable software that scales, moving as fast as possible without compromising the mentioned non-functional requirements.

In my first months I have been helping to evolve and refactor a product that serves 1B sessions per month, a massive monolith that is being progressively refactored into a microservices architecture.

In the last months I have been mainly contributing to the construction of the backend services for a new product that will revolutionize the way publishers get insights from their content. It's a highly observable and heterogeneous system where a non-blocking programming model is being used for high throughput.
