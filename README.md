## Summary

I am **Senior Backend Engineer** with +15y of experience in designing and building backend systems, cloud infrastructure, distributed systems and event-driven architectures, coupled with a strong sense ownership, a proven ability to mentor peers, experience in shaping and leading technical projects as well as trade off analysis. Throughout my career I’ve made impactful contributions to companies ranging from startups, scale-ups to established organizations.

Since I'll spend at least 1/3 of my life working, my highest motivation is to create as much possitive impact as possible with the work I do.

Curious by nature, constantly learning... - currently embracing AI to be a more efficient Engineer.


## Professional experience

### Senior Backend Engineer at Playtomic | Remote, Spain | April 2025 - Present

At Playtomic I joined the Payments Tribe, where it's an everyday challenge to deal with complexity, ambiguity and business-critical systems with poorly designed and hard to maintain code bases. So far I have successfully contributed in following areas:

- Migrating the core payments flow from a pessimistic to an optimistic locking strategy, which improved the payments processing latency from seconds (up +30s in some scenarios) to just a few milliseconds.
- Co-coordinated the Payments Platform roadmap, which resulted in several Code Quality improvement initiatives that I'm leading:
  - Code Quality Metrics & Quality Gates – PoC of mechanisms to assess, track and enforce code quality across services, with a focus on maintainability.
  - Defining Software Design & Architecture Principles – establishing guidelines emphasizing vertical slicing, I/O decoupling and domain modelling among other Engineering best practices in order to improve maintainability of the code bases.
- Automation of large scale changes accross repositories using Generative AI.
- Refactoring the core payments flow in order to reduce accumulated technical debt and standardizing payments processing, which would allow iterating faster in further product interations.
