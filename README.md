## Summary

~12y of experience in software engineering with an emphasis on backend systems and Java.

I believe that programming languages, frameworks and methodologies are tools that will only be helpful if they are used for the right problem. On the other hand, abstract thinking or isolating responsibilities among other engineering principles, are key factors to succeed in designing and implementing maintainable software that scales.

My most relevant personal and technical skills are:

- Capable of working both autonomously and as part of a team
- Good communication skills both in Spanish and English
- Capable of mentoring and guiding peers, both in-site and remote
- Pragmatic and simple approach to solve problems
- Proficient on various programming languages (Java, JavaScript/Node.js, Groovy)
- Experience in thread safe & concurrent software (e.g. concurrent sessions pools, parallel processing with Hazelcast IMDG, etc)
- Practical knowledge of functional and reactive programming
- REST & SOAP API design
- Experience in building observable and scalable micro-services architectures
- Design & implementation of modular, extendable and multi-tenant software
- Integration of third party APIs (Airline Reservation Systems, Booking Engines or payment gateways)

Beyond the professional realm, I'm a balanced human being who loves to enjoy time with family, friends and outdoors hobbies.


## Professional experience

### Senior Software Engineer at Marfeel | Barcelona, Spain | Jun 2020 - Present (~1y)

At Marfeel I'm part of one of the core platform teams where I'm shipping performant, reliable and maintainable software that scales, moving as fast as possible without compromising the mentioned non-functional requirements.

So far I have been helping to evolve and refactor a product that serves 1B sessions per month, a massive monolith that is being progressively refactored into a microservices architecture.

In the last months I have been mostly contributing to the construction of the backend services for a new product that will revolutionize the way publishers get insights from their content. It's a highly observable and heterogeneous system where a non-blocking programming model is being used for high throughput.
